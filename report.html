        1. I did not make a to-do list, instead I took my interest in basketball and recreated parts of some
        rosters in my database. <br>
        2. I used mySQL to create and store my database. <br>
        3. I have installed and used express in my project. <br>
        4. My project is avaiable by https://project2.lansfoml.me:8443/<br>
        5. My endpoints are appropriately named for their given function. <br>
        6. The web service sends and receives complex data as JSON. <br>
        7. The full spectrum of CRUD operations is supported. including GET,POST,PATCH,DELETE<br>
        8. I have used ufw to block all ports but the ones you need for SSH and your allowed web servers.
        so the database is directly accessible from within your droplet, and not from outside.
        Allowing ports 443, 22, 80 and 8443.<br>
        9. I have created an Nginx server that allows global, encrypted access to my web service.
        Following the commands from the textbook and changing the config file.<br>
        10. Following the exmaple from the textbook my service support cross-origin 
        resource sharing using custom middleware and an options wildcard endpoint. <br>
        11. Following the example from the textbook again, my web service must is started using a 
        process manager (pm2) so that it stays running.<br>
        12.
